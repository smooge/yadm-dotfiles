# Because I don't like to assume people can find links I am changing

# General rules of these config files is to be explicite versus
# implicit. We will use 'source' versus '.' and we will use variables
# versus like ${HOME} versus ~. The main goal is to be clearer for
# someone else to see what I am trying to do (or have stolen from
# others to be have done.)

# ~/.inputrc: readline initialization file.

# The latest version as installed by the Cygwin Setup program can
# always be found at /etc/defaults/etc/skel/.inputrc

# Modifying /etc/skel/.inputrc directly will prevent
# setup from updating it.

# The copy in your home directory (~/.inputrc) is yours, please
# feel free to customise it to create a shell
# environment to your liking.  If you feel a change
# would be benifitial to all, please feel free to send
